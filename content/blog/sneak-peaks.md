At the beginning of September, I took part in my first ultracycling adventure. I had registered for the entry-level (Entree) version of [Sneak Peaks](https://www.orbit360.cc/sneak-peaks). 500 km through the Dolomites and around 15.000 moe (meters of elevation).

[Matze](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/user/2746481733300) came along too. Looking forward to another adventure with you!

It was extremely exhausting and challenging, but at the same time I had the most wonderful moments on my bike during that event. And I met some great new people. Can't and won't say much more about it. It was epic. Thanks for organizing, Rapha.

I probably won't be able to take part again next year, as I already have another adventure lined up. But I'm already looking forward to the next ultra event.

Here are some not-so-difficult moments that I filmed with my iPhone during the event:
