I want to fill this place of the internet more often in the future. With random [thoughts](/tags/notepad), with [photos](/tags/moments), with beautiful [trips](/tags/outdoors) I took on my bike. Perhaps I will also share [challenges](/tags/code) in my daily life as a software engineer. We'll see how it goes.

Social media sucks often these days and who knows for how long it will still be a thing, right?

Here we go.

A big thank you to Tom MacWright for his great article “[How to blog](https://macwright.com/2019/02/06/how-to-blog.html)”. His post prompted me to switch the tech stack here to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for simplicity's sake. And to start blogging today.
