14. Two fantastic weeks of doing nothing in [Portugal](/blog/babymoon-in-portugal/).
15. The search for an apartment in Hamburg was successful.
16. The last quarter consisted mainly of preparations for the move, moving back to Hamburg, and settling into the new apartment.

It was a really good year. Deliberately exhausting, especially due to another move back to Hamburg. But also wonderful, as Linnea and I are returning as a married couple. Neither of us could have imagined that two or three years ago. We are currently preparing for our next adventure, as we are expecting a baby soon. It couldn't be better. I'm looking forward to the new year.
