It's almost unbearable.

Last week, Friedrich Merz did it again. In a [press conference](https://youtu.be/aCbmuwAaEXo?si=6rmf3TchthdYLni4) he said loosely translated “but of course we still have this problem in the cityscape” when talking about asylum seekers — another deliberate racist remark.

How can a German Chancellor in 2025 speak and act like this? Even the AfD doesn’t say such things this openly when talking with the press. Since the collapse of the “Ampel” (traffic light) coalition, Merz and his colleagues have been increasingly resorting to the rhetoric of the extreme right, regardless of the consequences.

Every public statement, every change in the law, every decision, the steady increase in police violence and racist border controls: everything is deliberately intended.

Our current government has no interest in real change — because the system works for them and their supporters. Strategically, everything that is happening is already preparing for the next federal election and possible cooperation with the increasingly powerful AfD.

Our government is failing.

CDU/CSU and SPD are neglecting their duties and harming our democracy. Instead of solving real issues like the housing crisis or social inequality, they fuel resentment against vulnerable people. Climate change has vanished from the agenda. I mean, what the fuck? Scientists and social researchers have been talking themselves hoarse for years. A quick search on the topic of “democratic backsliding how it happens and how it can be countered” offers many good opportunities to turn things around.

Conservatives and fascists sound the same these days. We’re in deep trouble and I think it's already too late in some areas to turn things around before the next election.

We must stop targeting the powerless and focus on real solutions — like a wealth tax.

We must show much more kindness, love, and solidarity toward all our fellow human beings and speak out loudly against racism and antisemitism.

A year ago, people across Germany stood up [against extremism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_German_anti-extremism_protests). It’s time to do it again. See you at the next demonstration.
