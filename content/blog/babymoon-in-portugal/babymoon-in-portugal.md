The last vacation together as a couple. Crazy! The first time we were in Portugal together. We had a great time in Porto. Many thanks to all our dear friends who shared their favorite places with us. üç® üçï

After a few days in Porto, we drove on to the Algarve. We stopped off in [Nazar√©](https://youtu.be/ZfLSN4mxY0E?si=lQTkvJzv1TXPbDRz), but unfortunately it was very cloudy that day and there wasn't much swell for big waves, still impressive. And it was crazy how many people this place attracts. Then we spent a night in Porto Covo, which is also a nice place for a stopover. The rest of our time we enjoyed in Budens and the surrounding area. Was so good to be back in this region and to share places we enjoyed earlier in our lives. If you're ever in the area, be sure to try a scoop of gelato at [Corso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cuyh41tpVnEho4dGA) in Burgau.
