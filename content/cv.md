## Manuel Puchta

**I'm a Web Engineer.** What I love to do: Building easy-to-use, responsive and accessible interfaces that put a smile on the face of people using them. Ensuring that everything scales well by designing and implementing the underlying architecture. Shipping frequently to live. Making a product better. Working in a team.

**Project: Kommunikationsplattform**

As part of an interdisciplinary team, I am helping to create a new web application in the judicial landscape: a communication platform (Kommunikationsplattform).
